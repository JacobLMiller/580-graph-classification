# 580-graph-classification

Execute all scripts from the top project directory 580-graph-classificaition. Running from any other directory will lead to incorrect paths during execution.

Main execution tests are in the Classifiers folder

**Good Drawings**
MDS
FDA
t-SNE

**Bad Drawings**
Random placement
Random shift

**Features**
Edge crossings (line sweep should work) x  
Stress  x
Neighborhood preservation  x
Angular Resolution   


**Immediate plan**
Implement/find feature computations
Write scripts to generate data
